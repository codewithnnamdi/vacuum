# Vacuum
# A numerical computation library for building Lua Games.
## Introduction

### Vacuum is inspired by the concepts of vacuums with physics. It is a numerical computation library for Lua. 

### Desgined for building games ,vacuum.lua is a numerical computation library for Lua.It is designed to be a lightweight library to be  for physics manipulation within game development.


## Features
1) Vector(2D,3D,4D) for vector manipulation
2) Matrix(2D,3D,4D) for linear algebra
3) Quaternion for rotation
